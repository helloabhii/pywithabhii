PYTHON :  
Python is a high level programming language.It is simple,Human Readable.It is used for Web Development,Data Analysis,AI etc.


VARIABLES IN PYTHON :
a = 10 
Here 'a' is called 'variable', '='' is assignment operator/assign and '10' is a 'integer'.
Variables used to stores any types of data/value like integer,float,string,complex.

DATA TYPES IN PYTHON :
These are built in Data Types.

1. Integer
for e.g 
a = 1
Here 'a' is a 'Integer' value

2. Float
a = 3.7
Here 'a' is a 'Float' value

3. String
a = "Abhii"
Here 'a' is a 'String' value

4. Complex
a = 1+ 2j
Here 'a' is a 'Complex' value 
means value with a character

5. Boolean
They only return True or False
print(5>3)
This will print True,because 'Boolean' can either true or false depends on the condition.

To know which type of data it is :
a = 10
print(type(a))
This will print the data type of 'a' 

Python is case sensitive language,Here a =! A. For e.g :
a = 10
A = 71
print(a) #10
print(A) #71
Both will print the different results

INDENTATION :
It is used in Conditions,Loops,Functions,Classes,Code Blocks etc.
for e.g :
if 3>2 :
  print("Three is greater than Two") 
The whitespace before print statement is called Indentation.
It is used by default by the python.

OPERATORS :
Operators in python are  symbols that perform operations on one or more operands(values or variables).

1. Arithmetic Operator :
 +(addition)
 -(subtraction)
 *(multiplication)
 /(division)
 %(modulus,remainder)
 **(exponentiation) #power
 //(floor division) 


2. Assignment Operator :
=(assign)
+=(add and assign)
-=(subtract and assign)
*=(multiply and assign)
/=(divide and assign)
%=(modulus and assign)
**=(exponentiation and assign)
//=(floor division and assign)

3. Comparison Operator :
==(equal to)
!=(not equal to)
<(less than)
>(greater than)
<=(less than equal to)
>=(greater than equal to)

4. Logical Operator :
and(logical AND)
or(logical OR)
not(logical NOT)

5. Identity Operator : used to compare the memory location of objects

is(true if both operands reference the same object)
is not(true if both operands reference different objects)

6. Membership Operator : used to test if a value is found in the sequence.

in(true if value is found in the sequence)
not in(true if both operands reference different objects)


7. Bitwise Operator : used to perform bitwise operations on integers

&(bitwise AND)
|(bitwise OR)
^(bitwise XOR)
~(bitwise NOT)
<<(left shift)
>>(right shift)
